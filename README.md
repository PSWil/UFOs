# UFOs  

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create an easy-to-use webpage that contains a dynamic table of data that was compiled from different UFO encounters around the US. The webpage was created using JavaScript and html and is filterable by several different criteria.

## Results

Bellow you can see an image of the final webpage. You can also visit the page [here](https://pswil.github.io/UFOs/index.html) if you like.

### Filtering the Table

The resulting page that includes some background on the history and controversy surrounding UFO sightings. Below this introduction is the table itself with some search boxes adjacent with several search criteria including Date, City, State, Country, Shape. 
In order to filter the table of date the user just needs to enter their desired criteria that they would like to search by, and press return to see the filtered data set. Users can immediately conduct a new search with new criteria in the search boxes or can return to the home page by clicking on 'UFO Sightings' in the top left corner. You can see the result of a filtered search below.

## Summary

### Drawbacks

The webpage and table do a very good job of displaying and filtering the data of UFO sightings in the US, it does however, have some shortcomings. The biggest drawback of the webpage in its current state is that it does not have the functionality to add live data, because of this the user can only see results from a specific time period and may not get all the relevant data that could be available. 

### Further Recommendations

There are many potential things we can do in order to improve the webpage and the usability of the table. 
1. My first recommendation would be to implement some functionality of the page in order to update the data set with new data as it comes in, either via APIâ€™s or web scrapping. With more current data being loaded into the data set, users will have a more complete understanding of the UFO sightings in the US. 
2. Additionally, search functionality is case sensitive so users must be careful to correctly enter the search criteria.


There are many things we could do to improve the overall experience and functionality of the table, but these two things should be a good start to make it a more relevant webpage.
