# UFOs  

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create an easy-to-use webpage that contains a dynamic table of data that was compiled from different UFO encounters around the US. The webpage was created using JavaScript and html and is filterable by several different criteria.

## Results

Bellow you can see an image of the final webpage. You can also visit the page [here](https://pswil.github.io/UFOs/index.html) if you like.

### Filtering the Table

The resulting page that includes some background on the history and controversy surrounding UFO sightings. Below this introduction is the table itself with some search boxes adjacent with several search criteria including Date, City, State, Country, Shape. 
In order to filter the table of date the user just needs to enter their desired criteria that they would like to search by, and press return to see the filtered data set. Users can immediately conduct a new search with new criteria in the search boxes or can return to the home page by clicking on 'UFO Sightings' in the top left corner. You can see the result of a filtered search below.

## Summary

### Drawbacks

The webpage and table do a very good job of displaying and filtering the data of UFO sightings in the US, it does however, have some shortcomings. The biggest drawback of the webpage in its current state is that it does not have the functionality to add live data, because of this the user can only see results from a specific time period and may not get all the relevant data that could be available. Additionally, search functionality is case sensitive so users must be careful to correctly enter the search criteria.

### Further Recommendations



- two recommendations for future changes would be the implement live data functionality and be able to filter both the duration of the sighting and buzz words from the comments.

- one drawback is that Javascript language is case sensitive. This is can impact the user experience because all of the searchable data is lowercase 
- there are over seven "shape" results for the shape filter. The filter currently allows the end user to filter shape data by simply typing the search criteria into the search field. A dropdown option would enhance the user experience if there were a dropdown option for "Shape" due to the broad range of descriptions. Those unfamiliar with UFO sightings may not know that "light" is considered a shape for UFOs.
